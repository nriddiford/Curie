##parameters chrLenFile and ploidy are required.
chrFiles = /data/kdi_prod/project_result/948/01.00/Analysis/Genomes/Dmel_6/fasta_for_CF/chromosomes

##Parameter "breakPointThreshold" specifies the maximal slope of the slope of residual sum of squares.
##This should be a positive value. The closer it is to Zero, the more breakpoints will be called. Its recommended value is between 0.01 and 0.08.

breakPointThreshold = .8

window = 50000

##If you provide a path to chromosome files, Control-FREEC will look for the following fasta files in your directory (in this order):
##1, 1.fa, 1.fasta, chr1.fa, chr1.fasta; 2, 2.fa, etc.
##Please ensure that you don't have other files but sequences having the listed names in this directory.
#chrFiles = path/hg19/

##If the parameter gemMappabilityFile is not specified, then the fraction of non-N nucleotides per window is used as Mappability.

#gemMappabilityFile = /GEM_mappability/out76.gem

##set BedGraphOutput=TRUE if you want to create a BedGraph track for visualization in the UCSC genome browser:
#BedGraphOutput=TRUE
