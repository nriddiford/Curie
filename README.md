## SVDetect

### About the tool
[SVDetect](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/15/1895.full.pdf) is a tool to identify genomic structural variations from paired-end and mate-pair sequencing data
Applying both sliding-window and clustering strategies, it uses anomalously mapped read pairs to localise genomic rearrangements and classify them according to their type e.g.:
* Large insertions and deletions
* Inversions
* Duplications
* Balanced and unbalanced inter-chromosomal translocations
